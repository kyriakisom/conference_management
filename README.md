# conference_management
The project involves creating a backend conference management system with RESTful web services that connect to a database for managing conference-related entities. Key functionalities include handling conferences and managing papers (manuscripts) submitted to these conferences.

#how_to_run_it
In the vscode terminal, type "npm install", to download the folder "node_modules" (The node_modules folder can become very large because it includes all dependencies required for the project, even those required by other dependencies, that's why you have to install it.) and then type "npm start", to start the server.
